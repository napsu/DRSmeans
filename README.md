# DRS-means - Distributed Random Swap for Minimum Sum-of-Squares Clustering

This repository contains a Python implementation of the DRS-means algorithm, based on its description in 

* O. Kozbagarov, R. Mussabayev, "[Distributed random swap: An efficient algorithm for minimum sum-of-squares clustering](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0020025524011186)", _Information Sciences_ 681 (2024) 121204.

The implementation by Tapio Pahikkala is based on [RandomSwap](https://github.com/uef-machine-learning/RandomSwap)-algorithm by Pasi Fränti and Juha Kivijärvi.
