# DRS-means - Distributed Random Swap for Minimum Sum-of-Squares Clustering

This repository contains a Python implementation of the DRS-means algorithm, based on its description in [1] by _Olzhas Kozbagarov_ and _Rustam Mussabayev_.
This implementation, created by _Tapio Pahikkala_, utilizes [RandomSwap](https://github.com/uef-machine-learning/RandomSwap)-algorithm by _Pasi Fr채nti_ and _Juha Kivij채rvi_ [2].


## Files included / needed
* DRSmeans.py
  - Main program for DRS-means
     
* random_swap.py
  - Random swap algorithm is available at https://github.com/uef-machine-learning/RandomSwap


## Installation and usage

To use the code:

  1. Download [RandomSwap](https://github.com/uef-machine-learning/RandomSwap) and the main program DRSmeans.py
  2. Define the data, no. clusters, and no. random swap iterations in the DRSmeans.py file.
  3. Finally, just type "python DRSmeans.py".

The algorithm returns the MSSC-function value and used time, as well as cluster centers and distributions.
